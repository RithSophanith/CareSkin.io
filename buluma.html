      ðŸ§¼&nbsp; Cleansing your face <br> is the first and very
      &nbsp; important step in any skincare routine. It removes dirt, makeup, and excess oil that clog pores and cause skin problems. Using a cleanser suited for your skin type helps keep your skin clean without damaging it. Use lukewarm water to open pores gently, and avoid using cleanser on dry skin to prevent irritation. Cleanse your face gently, avoiding harsh 
      scrubbing to maintain healthy skin. ðŸ§´<br></p>
